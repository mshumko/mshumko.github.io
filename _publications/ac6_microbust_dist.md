title: "Electron Microburst Size Distribution Derived with AeroCube-6"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'This paper describes the analysis to estimate the > 30 keV microburst size distribution in low Earth orbit and the magnetic equator. Then the microburst distribution is compared with the distribution of chorus waves to identify the wave properties favorable for scattering microburst electrons.'
