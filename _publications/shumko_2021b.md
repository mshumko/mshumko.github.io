title: "A Strong Correlation Between Relativistic Electron
Microbursts and Patchy Aurora"
collection: publications
abstract: "In this letter, we present the results of a conjunction between the Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX) satellite and a Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) all-sky imager in Gillam, Canada, showing a high correlation between relativistic, >1 MeV, electron microbursts and a type of pulsating aurora called patchy aurora. The correlation was 0.8, and is not serendipitous. While the relationship between pulsating aurora and 10â€“100s keV microbursts has been previously predicted, here we show a strong association between keV and MeV electron dynamics, possibly spanning two orders of magnitude. Importantly, this result shows that the dynamics of relativistic radiation belt electrons are at times intimately tied to keV electron precipitation, and cannot be studied in isolation."
