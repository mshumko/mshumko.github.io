I study Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupling & Auroral Dynamics, with a focus on energetic (relativistic) particle precipitation from space into Earth's atmosphere using multipoint measurements---originally multiple satellites, and now including all-sky imagers stationed at high latitudes. With the space- and ground-based observatory perspectives, my scientific ambition is to understand physical phenomena as a system as it evolves in space and time.

## Current Projects
My scientific pursuit has three themes.

First theme is to understand the connection and impacts of the aurora with relativistic particle precipitation in Earth's high-latitude region. To make progress on this topic I am studying a type of diffuse aurora called pulsating aurora. This form of aurora is believed to be generated by wave-particle interactions between whistler-mode chorus and electrons in the magnetosphere. Microbursts are also believed to be scattered by chorus waves. Both phenomena have two distinct time frames: microbursts typically come in bunches lasting up to 10 seconds while pulsating aurora has an on-off periods lasting about the same time, and individual relativistic microbursts [last ~100 ms](https://mshumko.github.io/publications/shumko_2021a/) while pulsating aurora has internal modulations with a 300 ms period. The closeness of these two time scales, along with other arguments I present [here](https://mshumko.github.io/publications/shumko_2021b/), presents a compelling case that pulsating aurora and microbursts are part of the same phenomena.

That said, these are all case studies and I am now pursing the LAMPsat mission to statistically test this association.

The second theme is to map the auroral and energetic precipitation to their magnetospheric sources...

And the third theme is to understand the mechanisms that are responsible for plasma sheet electron acceleration to relativistic energies, and their subsequent scattering into Earth's atmosphere.

I am also working on my first comprehensive Python package called [asilib](https://aurora-asi-lib.readthedocs.io/). This project is the culmination of my learning journey to build a user-friendly library that allows a researcher to "easily download, plot, animate, and analyze auroral all sky imager (ASI) data." While working on this library I learned a whole lot including software engineering concepts as, simple software architecture, comprehensive tests, and useful documentation. Furthermore, I've learned a lot about the aurora and how it is analyzed. This work is deeply fulfilling, and I believe that we could use more software like this in space physics to reduce the barriers to entry for new scientists. They don't have to learn to do basic tasks including how to download or load the data: they can pip install `asilib` and immediately start working with auroral images.

## Probability Theory
Besides analyzing time series and image data to study microbursts and curtain precipitation, I develop models to link data to reality---or our best understanding of reality.

Broadly, I am interested in probabilistic methods such as Bayesian Inference (see my [2020](../_publications/shumko_2020a.md) and [2023](../_publications/shumko_2023.md) papers). I am very interested in these models because they allow a modeler to explicitly incorporate statistical and systematic uncertainty into model to make statistically-guided inferences about results.
