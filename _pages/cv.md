* M.S. in Physics, Montana State University, 2016
* Ph.D in Physics, Montana State University, 2019

Work experience
======
* Space Sciences and Engineering Laboratory \| September 2014 - Present \| Graduate Research Assistant & Postdoctoral researcher
  * Command and operate FIREBIRD-II CubeSats. Developed the data pipeline to get the data from FIREBIRD to the internet in less than 24 hours.
  * Analyze time series data from the FIREBIRD-II and AC6 CubeSat missions to study microbursts (see the [Publication Section](/research/)*)
  * Organize Precipitation Workshop in 2019
  * Advised an REU and undergraduate students

* Los Alamos National Laboratory \| June - July 2018 \| Summer Student
  * Performed a sensitivity analysis of the Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
  * Converted modeleted flux using geant sensitivity curves
  * Mentors: Brian Larsen and Phill Fernandez 
  * Report found here

* The Aerospace Corportation \| June - August 2017 \| Summer Intern
  * Calculated when pairs of spacecraft are near the same Earth's magnetic field line (magnetic conjunction)
  * Found evidence of microbursts inside the radiation belts
  * Applied the theory of quasi-linear diffusion to model the transport of electrons in phase space.
  * Mentors: Drew Turner
  * Paper can be found here
