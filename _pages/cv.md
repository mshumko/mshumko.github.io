Education
======
* B.S. in Astrophysics, University of California, Santa Cruz, 2014 [thesis found here](../files/senior_thesis.pdf)
* M.S. in Physics, Montana State University, 2016
* Ph.D in Physics, Montana State University, 2019 [dissertation found here](../files/shumko_dissertation_final.pdf)

Work experience
======
* Space Sciences and Engineering Laboratory \| September 2014 - Present \| Graduate Research Assistant & Postdoctoral researcher
  * Command and operate FIREBIRD-II CubeSats. Developed the data pipeline to get the data from FIREBIRD to the [internet](http://solar.physics.montana.edu/FIREBIRD_II/) in less than 24 hours
  * Analyzed time series data from the FIREBIRD-II and AC6 CubeSat missions to study microbursts (these analyses lead to two publications described in the [Publication Section](/publications/))
  * Developed a Python wrapper for [IRBEM-Lib](https://sourceforge.net/p/irbem/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/python/)
  * Organized The 2019 Particle Precipitation Workshop at The University of New Hampshire
  * Earned a Technician Class ham radio license
  * Co-director of [The Rocky Mountain Data Science](rmds.tech) club
  * Advised an REU and undergraduate students

* Los Alamos National Laboratory \| June - July 2018 \| Summer Student
  * Performed a sensitivity analysis of the Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
  * Converted modeleted flux using geant sensitivity curves
  * Documented my work in a [report](https://www.lanl.gov/projects/national-security-education-center/space-earth-center/space-weather-school/_assets/docs/swx-report-2018.pdf)

* The Aerospace Corportation \| June - August 2017 \| Summer Intern
  * Systematically calculated when pairs of spacecraft are near the same Earth's magnetic field line (magnetic conjunction)
  * Found evidence of microbursts inside the radiation belts
  * Applied the theory of quasi-linear diffusion to model the transport of electrons in phase space
  * The microburst work lead to a [publication](/publications/rbsp_microburst_paper/) and collaboration is ongoing
