Hi there! I am a space physicist working at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory as a postdoctoral fellow.

My diverse research interests are to advance our understanding of the ionosphere, inner magnetosphere, and magnetotail environments. My work leverages innovative data analysis techniques across a wide range of in-situ and remote sensing observatories to study the magnetosphere as a coupled system. Currently my two main science goals are:

1. Understand the mechanisms that are responsible for plasma sheet electron acceleration to relativistic energies, and their subsequent scattering into Earth's atmosphere, and
2. Understand the mechanisms and impacts of relativistic particle precipitation in Earth's inner magnetosphere. 

At the lower energy end, this precipitation creates beautiful displays of the aurora near the northern and southern poles. At the higher energy end, however, these particles emit X-rays that can be hazardous to humans and to our technological presence in space and upper atmosphere (think aviation and above).

Beyond my data analysis pursuits, developing the [asilib](https://aurora-asi-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) python library where I've learned to use Software Engineering best practices in analyzing auroral all-sky imager (ASI) data. I also lead the Loss through Auroral Microburst Pulsations mission (LAMPsat)---a CubeSat mission concept to simultaneously image pulsating aurora together with the relativistic electrons, to test the [Miyoshi+2020](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL090360) hypothesis that relativistic microbursts are the high energy tail of the pulsating aurora phenomenon. 

Want to learn more? Head on over to the [Publications](/publications/) section to read more about my scientific work, or the [Research](/research/) section to see movies of the aurora.

## Exercise and data analysis
On the topic of data analysis, here is a global heatmap showing where I've explored.
